# Common Tier 1 Escalation Criteria

## Purpose  
This document defines standard Tier 1 escalation triggers, ensuring prompt and appropriate handoff to Tier 2 support. It reduces resolution delays, ensures SLA compliance, and avoids over-troubleshooting beyond Tier 1 scope.

## Audience  
- Tier 1 Helpdesk / IT Support  
- Service Desk Analysts  
- IT Managers overseeing ticket triage  

## When to Use This Guide  
Use this guide:  
- When Tier 1 troubleshooting does not resolve the issue  
- When the issue is out of Tier 1 scope or permissions  
- When a technical escalation is required due to complexity, system-level changes, or risk

## General Escalation Triggers

| Criteria                     | Escalate To Tier 2 If...                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Issue Unresolved After Standard Steps | L1 steps exhausted and user still blocked             |
| Permissions Required          | Task needs elevated rights (e.g., AD group changes, registry edits) |
| System/Application Issue      | Impacting multiple users or appears to be service-wide  |
| Repeat or Recurring Tickets   | Same issue persists despite attempted fixes             |
| System Errors                | System-level error messages, BSOD, or logs beyond Tier 1 training |
| Performance Issues           | Not resolved with reboot, task manager cleanup, or single app reinstall |
| Email Issues (Advanced)      | Outlook PST repair, delegate access failures, mailbox corruption |
| Hardware Failures            | Physical damage, BIOS/firmware issues, or needs vendor service |
| Network Issues              | VLAN, DNS, DHCP, or switch-specific issues not tied to user endpoint |
| Server Resource Requests     | File share permissions, server access, drive mapping changes |
| New Software or Tools        | Unapproved or custom apps needing Tier 2 vetting or packaging |
| Installation Fails or Errors | When MSI/MST troubleshooting is needed                   |
| User Data Recovery           | Backup restore, PST recovery, OneDrive/SharePoint recovery |
| MFA or SSO Failures          | Not fixable through reset or standard MFA re-enroll steps |
| Citrix/RDP/VPN Connection Errors | Not resolved with standard Tier 1 connectivity steps   |

## Tier 1 “Do Not Attempt” List  
*(Always escalate)*

| Task                         | Reason                                             |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Changing AD security group policies | Requires audit/log tracking & admin privileges   |
| Email restore from server (Exchange) | Requires backup or admin console access          |
| Complex scripting or GPO troubleshooting | Out of Tier 1 training and authority            |
| Device encryption/decryption | Risk of data loss; handled by Tier 2/3             |
| BIOS/UEFI updates            | Potentially system-breaking                         |
| Server changes              | Always Tier 2+                                     |
| App packaging or SCCM deployment | Needs Tier 2 engineer or deployment team          |
| Data recovery from failed drives | Escalate to Tier 2 or vendor support              |

## How to Escalate (Best Practices)

- **Document Everything clearly in the ticket:**  
  - What troubleshooting was done  
  - Relevant screenshots or error logs  
  - Impact level and urgency  
  - Affected user(s), system(s), and location(s)  

- **Tag or Assign to Tier 2 Queue**  
- Use the appropriate Jira category or escalation label  
- Use internal handoff templates, if required  

- **Communicate with User:**  
  - Let them know it’s being escalated  
  - Provide expected follow-up time, if available  

- **Flag Urgent Issues:**  
  - Use high priority label if it blocks multiple users or critical operations  
  - Notify Tier 2 by Teams/Slack/email if response is time-sensitive

## Notes for Tier 1 Staff  
-  If you’re unsure whether to escalate, it’s better to ask or escalate with notes  
-  Avoid “pass-the-ticket” behavior — always perform basic troubleshooting first  
-  Keep the ticket updated — Tier 2 relies on your notes for fast triage
