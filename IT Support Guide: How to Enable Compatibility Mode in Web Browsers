# Compatibility Mode (IE Mode) – Support Guide

## Purpose

Some legacy web applications or internal portals may not display properly in modern browsers due to outdated code. This guide explains how to use **Compatibility Mode**, primarily through **Internet Explorer (IE) Mode** in **Microsoft Edge**, which is now the standard method for viewing legacy sites.

---

## When to Use This Guide

Use Compatibility Mode when a user reports that:

- A legacy app doesn't render correctly in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox  
- Buttons or dropdowns don’t work as expected  
- They require IE-only functionality (e.g., ActiveX, old intranet apps)
